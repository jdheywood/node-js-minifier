This is an attempt to translate [this Perl JS minifier](https://github.com/zoffixznet/JavaScript-Minifier) into Javascript, I thought I'd use a little node server to run it too as it's a nice little self contained app.

* JS minifier in JS via node
* Version 0.1

### How do I get set up? ###

* Install node
* Clone this repo
* $ npm install
* $ node index.js
* visit http://localhost:8888
* upload your javascript file
* wonder at the minified response!
* How to run tests; visit http://localhost:8888/test
