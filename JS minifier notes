JS minifier notes

Perhaps need to update my version of node to take advantage of ES6 classes?

Create a class (use ES6 feature of javascript)

JsFile(
	input, string
	length, int
	currentPosition, int
	lastPosition, int
	char1, char
	char2, char
	char3, char
	char4, char
	output, string
	result, string

	read(), function
	skip(numberOfChars int), function
	write(), function

	minify(), function
)

properties:

input is the string of the js file coming in
length is the number of characters in the input js
currentPosition is the current position in the input js string
lastPosition is the position in the input js string we were at before attempting the current step in the minification, for back-tracking purposes should this be required
char1 is the character at the current position
char2 is the character at the current position + 1
char3 is the character at the current position + 2
char4 is the character at the current position + 3
output is the minified version of the input js
result is a string message detailing what happened, either 'success!' or 'fail: <reason>'

methods:

read() sets the char1, char2, char3 and char4 properties based off the position property
skip(numberOfChars int) skips a number of characters and sets the position property accordingly
write() writes the char at the current position
minify() the entry point, starts at first position and writes a minified version of the input property character by character to the output property
